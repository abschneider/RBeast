### GLM creatoR

These are couple simple functions to parse XMLs for [generalised linear models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model) (GLM) with [BEAST](http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/).

**Code is still under development**. The idea is to provide a function (and possibly a shiny app) such that the user can easily construct a BEAST XML from their data.

See the [examples](https://github.com/maxbiostat/RBeast/tree/master/R/glm_creator/examples) folder for two simple XMLs created using the scripts in this folder.
